# SECURE ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES FOR CLOUD
The use of cutting-edge technologies, methodologies, and programming to protect your 
cloud-based application is referred to as cloud security. The importance of security in 
cloud computing cannot be overstated. To keep sensitive information safe in Cloud 
Computing, we must use strong techniques to protect it from attackers. In todayâ€™s world, 
creating a security system that will last a lifetime is extremely difficult, as attackers 
gain more ways to access data as time progresses. Hence, we create a web-based 
application that uses several coding levels, including the DNA algorithm, Vigenere 
Cipher, and AES algorithm, to achieve greater confidentiality before loading into cloud 
storage. 


Cloud security is an evolving sub-domain of computer and network security. Cloud 
platform utilizes third-party data centers model. An example of cloud platform as a 
service (PaaS) is Heroku. It supports several programming languages that are used for 
web application deployment model. Heroku is based on a managed container system, 
with integrated data services and a powerful ecosystem, for deploying and running 
modern apps. One essential issue in cloud computing is data security, which is handled 
using cryptography methods.
